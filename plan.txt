Problem 1 (1hr)
    Part A
        -Clean, clear and reuseable way.
        -Determines whether a given number is prime (factors are 1 and itself)
        -If not prime, capture factors in appropriate data structure and output them.
        -If number is prime - output as string.

        Plan
            -Prime number divided by itself and 1.
            -Can use modulus % operator to find remainder after division and then find factors
            factors of a number (numbers that will divide into it).

            -Basic function takes in number, called "n".
            -Use a loop to increase a number in a variable then check if that number is a factor of "n",
            using modulus operator and checking for remainder.
            -If it is a factor then increase a count by 1. Then carry on.
            -If this count goes past 2, i.e more factors than itself and one. Then the number isn't prime.





    Part B
        -Create a web interface for the problem above.
        -Allow user to enter a number, or specify a range.
        -Then page updates with result of requested operation.
        -Include any HTML/JS/CSS needed.
